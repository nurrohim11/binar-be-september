        of the <span style="color:blue">printing</span> and typesetting industry. </br>
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, </br>
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. </br>
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, </br>
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset</br> 
        <p>sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like </p>
        Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
